    "## Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns not only the underlying pattern but also the noise in the training data. This results in poor generalization to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems:**\n",
    "- Poor generalization to new data.\n",
    "- High variance and low bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques to Address Overfitting:**\n",
    "- **Cross-validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "- **Pruning:** In decision trees, prune the tree to avoid learning noise.\n",
    "- **Regularization:** Apply L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization.\n",
    "- **Early Stopping:** Stop training when performance on validation data starts to degrade.\n",
    "- **Ensemble Methods:** Use techniques like bagging and boosting.\n",
    "- **Dropout:** In neural networks, randomly drop neurons during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications:**\n",
    "- High bias and low variance.\n",
    "- Poor performance on both training and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prevention Techniques:**\n",
    "- **Increase Model Complexity:** Use more complex algorithms.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Create better features.\n",
    "- **Increase Training Time:** Allow the model to train for longer periods.\n",
    "- **Reduce Regularization:** Decrease the regularization parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bias-Variance Trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balance:**\n",
    "- **Bias:** Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm.\n",
    "- **Variance:** Error due to excessive complexity in the learning algorithm.\n",
    "- **Trade-off:** Aim for a balance where both bias and variance are minimized for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Techniques:**\n",
    "- **Deletion:** Remove missing data.\n",
    "  - Pros: Simple, easy to implement.\n",
    "  - Cons: Loss of valuable data, can lead to biased results.\n",
    "- **Imputation:** Fill in missing data.\n",
    "  - Methods: Mean, median, mode, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), regression imputation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Ignoring Missing Data:**\n",
    "- **Implications:** Can lead to biased results and reduced statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imputation Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- **Mean/Median/Mode:** Simple, fast, works well with small amounts of missing data.\n",
    "- **KNN/Regression:** More accurate, preserves relationships in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- **Mean/Median/Mode:** Can distort variance, ignore feature relationships.\n",
    "- **KNN/Regression:** Computationally intensive, can introduce noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Java + DSA\n",
    "\n",
    "*Content related to Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) can be added as per your requirements.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missing Data and Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effects:**\n",
    "- Can reduce the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "- Can introduce bias.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Occurs when the classes in a dataset are not represented equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "- Biased model performance.\n",
    "- Difficulty in training models that generalize well.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Up-sampling and Down-sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "- **Up-sampling:** Duplicate minority class samples or generate synthetic samples.\n",
    "- **Down-sampling:** Randomly remove majority class samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage:**\n",
    "- Use up-sampling when data is limited.\n",
    "- Use down-sampling when computational resources are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SMOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) creates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class samples.\n",
    "\n",

    "Helps in balancing the class distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Improves model performance on minority class.\n",
