    "A Python library is a collection of related modules12. It contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs1. Each module in a library is a file containing Python definitions and statements3. The library makes Python programming simpler and more convenient for the programmer, as they don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Python libraries for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Libraries contain precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations1. This increases code reusability as the same code can be used in various relevant projects and operations2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: Libraries provide pre-written and optimized code, which can make your programs more efficient and faster1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Libraries often have functions that simplify complex coding tasks, making it easier for programmers to implement functionality without having to worry about the details1."

    "The main differences between a Numpy array and a Python list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Type:\n",
    "Numpy Array: It is a homogeneous array, which means all elements in the array must be of the same data type12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python List: It can be heterogeneous, meaning it can hold different data types1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Memory Usage and Performance:\n",
    "Numpy Array: It stores elements of the same data type, making them more compact and memory-efficient than lists1. It also facilitates advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data1. These operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Python’s built-in sequences1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python List: Lists in Python store additional information about each element, such as its type and reference count1. This overhead can be significant when dealing with a large number of elements1. Lists may not store elements in contiguous memory locations, causing memory fragmentation and inefficiency1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Operations:\n",
    "Numpy Array: Element-wise operation is possible1. It has various functions, methods, and variables, to ease our task of matrix computation1.\n",
    "Python List: Element-wise operation is not possible on the list1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Dimension:\n",
    "Numpy Array: We can create an N-dimensional array in Python using Numpy1.\n",
    "Python List: Python list is by default 1-dimensional. But we can create an N-Dimensional list1.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Size:\n",
    "Numpy Array: You can’t change the size of a numpy array without making a full copy34.\n",
    "Python List: You can append elements to a list34."
