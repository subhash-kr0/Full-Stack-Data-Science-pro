    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "1. **Monitor Performance:** Track the performance of the boosting model on a validation set.\n",
    "2. **Set Criteria:** Define a stopping criterion, such as a maximum number of iterations or a performance threshold.\n",
    "3. **Stop Training:** Cease training when the model performance on the validation set no longer improves or starts to degrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preventing Overfitting:**\n",
    "Early stopping prevents overfitting by halting the training process before the model begins to overfit the training data, thereby improving generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameters in Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role:**\n",
    "- **Learning Rate:** Controls the contribution of each weak learner to the final model.\n",
    "- **Number of Iterations:** Determines the number of boosting rounds.\n",
    "- **Max Depth of Trees:** Limits the complexity of each weak learner (if using decision trees).\n",
