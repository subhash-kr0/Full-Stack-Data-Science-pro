    "## Ensemble Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Ensemble techniques involve combining multiple models to improve overall predictive performance and robustness. The key idea is that a group of models (ensemble) can make more accurate predictions than individual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types:**\n",
    "- Bagging\n",
    "- Boosting\n",
    "- Stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble method that improves the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms by combining predictions from multiple models trained on different subsets of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "1. Generate multiple subsets of the training data using bootstrapping (sampling with replacement).\n",
    "2. Train a separate model on each subset.\n",
    "3. Aggregate the predictions (e.g., voting for classification, averaging for regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of Bootstrapping:**\n",
    "Bootstrapping helps in creating diverse training datasets for each model, which reduces variance and prevents overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Forest Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "1. Construct multiple decision trees using bootstrapped samples of the data.\n",
    "2. At each split in the trees, a random subset of features is considered.\n",
    "3. Aggregate the predictions of all trees (majority vote for classification, average for regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomization and Overfitting:**\n",
    "Randomization (random feature selection) reduces the correlation between trees, leading to reduced overfitting compared to a single decision tree.\n",
