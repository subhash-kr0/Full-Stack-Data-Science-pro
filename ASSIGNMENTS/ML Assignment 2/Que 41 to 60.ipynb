    "## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It predicts the label of a new instance based on the labels of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "1. Choose the number of neighbors (k).\n",
    "2. Calculate the distance between the new instance and all training instances (commonly using Euclidean distance).\n",
    "3. Identify the k-nearest neighbors.\n",
    "4. For classification: Assign the label that is most common among the k-nearest neighbors.\n",
    "5. For regression: Assign the average value of the labels of the k-nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
