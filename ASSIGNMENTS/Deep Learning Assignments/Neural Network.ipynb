    "\n",
    "### 4. **Illustrate the architecture of an artificial neural network. Provide an example to explain the flow of information through the network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "An artificial neural network typically consists of three layers:\n",

    "## Weight Initialization Techniques Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is the vanishing gradient problem in deep neural networks? How does it affect training?\n",
    "Solution: The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients (calculated during backpropagation) become very small, causing weights to update very slowly or stop updating entirely. This can happen when activation functions like Sigmoid or Tanh squash their outputs into a small range, leading to small gradients during backpropagation. It affects training by making it hard for deep networks to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Explain how Xavier initialization addresses the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Xavier initialization (also known as Glorot initialization) sets the initial weights in a way that keeps the variance of the gradients roughly constant across layers. It achieves this by drawing weights from a distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 2 / (number_of_input_neurons + number_of_output_neurons). This helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, especially for activation functions like Sigmoid and Tanh.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What are some common activation functions that are prone to causing vanishing gradients?\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid: Due to its output range of [0, 1], the gradient can become very small for extreme values of input, leading to vanishing gradients.\n",
    "Tanh: Similar to Sigmoid, but with output in the range [-1, 1], leading to small gradients in saturated regions of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Define the exploding gradient problem in deep neural networks. How does it impact training?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: The exploding gradient problem occurs when gradients become very large during backpropagation, causing weights to update by excessively large amounts. This can lead to numerical instability, where the model's weights become too large, and the model fails to converge or diverges completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is the role of proper weight initialization in training deep neural networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Proper weight initialization ensures that gradients neither vanish nor explode, allowing the network to converge more quickly and stably. It helps avoid issues like the vanishing/exploding gradient problem and ensures that the network learns efficiently during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Explain the concept of batch normalization and its impact on weight initialization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Batch normalization normalizes the output of each layer by adjusting the mean and variance to maintain a stable distribution of activations throughout training. It helps mitigate the vanishing/exploding gradient problem by keeping the activations centered and ensures that the network can learn faster, reducing the need for careful weight initialization.\n",
