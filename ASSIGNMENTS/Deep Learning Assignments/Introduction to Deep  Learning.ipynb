    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Extraction**:\n",
    "   - Convolutional layers detect local patterns (e.g., edges, textures) in an image by applying **filters (kernels)**.\n",
    "   - Deeper layers combine these simple features into more complex structures, such as shapes or objects.\n",

    "### What Pooling Layers Achieve:\n",
    "\n",
