Specifically, the resulting dtype is now `CategoricalDtype(categories=[0, 1, 2], ordered=True, categories_dtype=int64)` where it previously was just `int64`. \\r\\n\\r\\nOther things I\\'ve noticed\\r\\n- The other ways of doing this calculation, `s.groupby(s).nunique()` and `s.groupby(s).unique().apply(len)` still produce `int64` dtypes, which leads me to think that that is the correct dtype here. \\r\\n- There are some instances where `int64` dtype still gets used. If `s` is `pd.Series(pd.Categorical([1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], categories=[1, 2, 3], ordered=True))`, this problem does not occur.\\r\\n- If the categories aren\\'t numeric, say `s` is `pd.Series(pd.Categorical([\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\'], categories=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], ordered=True))` we still get the `int64` dtype, so this seems to only be a problem with numeric categories.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am using `.agg` since I want to make the call to `pd.Series.nunique` along with other aggregation functions at the same time, so I do not currently have a good workaround other than converting these categorical columns to be `int64`. The category dtype is problematic, as I am performing another groupby aggregation on the results, and this is resulting in `TypeError: category type does not support sum operations` errors on the categorical columns which were previously `int64`.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\n`s.groupby(s).agg(pd.Series.nunique)` should produce a series with the `int64` dtype that is equal to the other ways of performing this calculation. The following should run without problems: \\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\ns = pd.Series(pd.Categorical([0, 1, 2, 0, 1], categories=[0, 1, 2], ordered=True))\\r\\n\\r\\nvia_agg = s.groupby(s).agg(pd.Series.nunique)\\r\\ndirect = s.groupby(s).nunique()\\r\\n\\r\\npd.testing.assert_series_equal(via_agg, direct)\\r\\n\\r\\n# My use-case should now work\\r\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\\'col1\\': via_agg, \\'col2\\': [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\']})\\r\\ndf.groupby([\\'col2\\']).sum()\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : fd3f57170aa1af588ba877e8e28c158a20a4886d\\r\\npython                : 3.10.13.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 21.6.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 21.6.0: Fri Sep 15 16:17:04 PDT 2023; root:xnu-8020.240.18.703.5~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\\r\\nmachine               : arm64\\r\\nprocessor             : arm\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.23.5\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 65.5.0\\r\\npip                   : 23.0.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : 8.0.0\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : 5.1.1\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : 8.4.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.2.0\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.7.2\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 12.0.1\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.4\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\n\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\n\\n- [ ] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\n\\n\\n### Reproducible Example\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\nfor dtype in [np.int8, pd.Int8Dtype()]:\\r\\n    df1 = pd.DataFrame(\\r\\n        data={\\r\\n            \"col1\": pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], dtype=dtype),\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        index=pd.Index([\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], dtype=pd.StringDtype()),\\r\\n    )\\r\\n    df2 = pd.DataFrame(\\r\\n        data={\\r\\n            \"col2\": pd.Series([4, 5, 6], index=[\"D\", \"E\", \"F\"], dtype=dtype),\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        index=pd.Index([\"D\", \"E\", \"F\"], dtype=pd.StringDtype()),\\r\\n    )\\r\\n    df = pd.concat([df1, df2])\\r\\n    group = df.T.groupby(df.columns)\\r\\n    max_df = group.max()\\r\\n    print(max_df)\\r\\n    print()\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Issue Description\\n\\nI\\'m running into a `ValueError: ndarray is not C-contiguous` exception when attempting to aggregate a concatenated dataframe. Strangely though, the exception only seems to occur if the column dtypes are `pd.Int8Dtype()`, but not if they are `np.int8`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe example illustrates this issue. The first iteration of the loop runs properly, printing the following output:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n        A    B    C    D    E    F\\r\\ncol1  1.0  2.0  3.0  NaN  NaN  NaN\\r\\ncol2  NaN  NaN  NaN  4.0  5.0  6.0\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the second iteration raises an unhandled exception on the `group.max()` call. Here is my (sanitized) callstack:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\r\\n  File \"/Users/redacted/git/myproject/foo.py\", line 19, in <module>\\r\\n    max_df = group.max()\\r\\n  File \"/Users/redacted/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-f89bfaSs-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/groupby/groupby.py\", line 3330, in max\\r\\n    return self._agg_general(\\r\\n  File \"/Users/redacted/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-f89bfaSs-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/groupby/groupby.py\", line 1906, in _agg_general\\r\\n    result = self._cython_agg_general(\\r\\n  File \"/Users/redacted/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-f89bfaSs-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/groupby/groupby.py\", line 1998, in _cython_agg_general\\r\\n    new_mgr = data.grouped_reduce(array_func)\\r\\n  File \"/Users/redacted/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-f89bfaSs-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/internals/managers.py\", line 1473, in grouped_reduce\\r\\n    applied = blk.apply(func)\\r\\n  File \"/Users/redacted/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-f89bfaSs-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/internals/blocks.py\", line 393, in apply\\r\\n    result = func(self.values, **kwargs)\\r\\n  File \"/Users/redacted/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-f89bfaSs-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/groupby/groupby.py\", line 1973, in array_func\\r\\n    result = self._grouper._cython_operation(\\r\\n  File \"/Users/redacted/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-f89bfaSs-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/groupby/ops.py\", line 830, in _cython_operation\\r\\n    return cy_op.cython_operation(\\r\\n  File \"/Users/redacted/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-f89bfaSs-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/groupby/ops.py\", line 540, in cython_operation\\r\\n    return values._groupby_op(\\r\\n  File \"/Users/redacted/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-f89bfaSs-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/arrays/masked.py\", line 1587, in _groupby_op\\r\\n    res_values = op._cython_op_ndim_compat(\\r\\n  File \"/Users/redacted/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-f89bfaSs-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/groupby/ops.py\", line 329, in _cython_op_ndim_compat\\r\\n    res = self._call_cython_op(\\r\\n  File \"/Users/redacted/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/myproject-f89bfaSs-py3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pandas/core/groupby/ops.py\", line 418, in _call_cython_op\\r\\n    func(\\r\\n  File \"groupby.pyx\", line 1835, in pandas._libs.groupby.group_max\\r\\n  File \"<stringsource>\", line 663, in View.MemoryView.memoryview_cwrapper\\r\\n  File \"<stringsource>\", line 353, in View.MemoryView.memoryview.__cinit__\\r\\nValueError: ndarray is not C-contiguous\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nI discovered this issue when upgrading my code from _pandas_ `v1.5.3` to `v2.2.0`. With some trial and error though, I was able to determine that this issue was introduced with the `v2.1.0` release. (i.e. this issue does _not_ occur with `v2.0.3`)\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI would expect both iterations of the for-loop in the example code to behave identically. However, only the first iteration succeeds; the second iteration raises an unhandled exception on the `group.max()` call.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : fd3f57170aa1af588ba877e8e28c158a20a4886d\\r\\npython                : 3.9.17.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 23.3.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 23.3.0: Wed Dec 20 21:28:58 PST 2023; root:xnu-10002.81.5~7/RELEASE_X86_64\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : i386\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.0.3\\r\\npip                   : 23.0.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : 7.4.4\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.9\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : None\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2023.12.2\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 12.0.1\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : 2023.12.2\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.25\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.4\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

It raises an error if a mixed-type column is used for sorting and succeeds if multiple columns are used, where one of them is a mixed-type column.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nThe behvior should be consistent irrespective of the number of columns being used for sorting.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit           : 0f437949513225922d851e9581723d82120684a6\\r\\npython           : 3.9.16.final.0\\r\\npython-bits      : 64\\r\\nOS               : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release       : 22.5.0\\r\\nVersion          : Darwin Kernel Version 22.5.0: Thu Jun  8 22:22:22 PDT 2023; root:xnu-8796.121.3~7/RELEASE_X86_64\\r\\nmachine          : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor        : i386\\r\\nbyteorder        : little\\r\\nLC_ALL           : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLANG             : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE           : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\npandas           : 2.0.3\\r\\nnumpy            : 1.24.3\\r\\npytz             : 2022.1\\r\\ndateutil         : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools       : 65.5.1\\r\\npip              : 22.0.4\\r\\nCython           : None\\r\\npytest           : None\\r\\nhypothesis       : None\\r\\nsphinx           : None\\r\\nblosc            : None\\r\\nfeather          : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter       : 3.0.3\\r\\nlxml.etree       : 4.9.1\\r\\nhtml5lib         : None\\r\\npymysql          : None\\r\\npsycopg2         : 2.9.3\\r\\njinja2           : 3.0.1\\r\\nIPython          : 8.10.0\\r\\npandas_datareader: None\\r\\nbs4              : 4.11.1\\r\\nbottleneck       : None\\r\\nbrotli           : None\\r\\nfastparquet      : None\\r\\nfsspec           : 2022.5.0\\r\\ngcsfs            : None\\r\\nmatplotlib       : 3.7.0\\r\\nnumba            : None\\r\\nnumexpr          : None\\r\\nodfpy            : None\\r\\nopenpyxl         : 3.0.9\\r\\npandas_gbq       : None\\r\\npyarrow          : 14.0.1\\r\\npyreadstat       : None\\r\\npyxlsb           : None\\r\\ns3fs             : None\\r\\nscipy            : None\\r\\nsnappy           : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy       : None\\r\\ntables           : None\\r\\ntabulate         : 0.8.9\\r\\nxarray           : None\\r\\nxlrd             : None\\r\\nzstandard        : None\\r\\ntzdata           : 2022.1\\r\\nqtpy             : None\\r\\npyqt5            : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

As well as being unexpected behaviour, this also results in this case in NaNs in the index, which also has the side effect of changing the index type to float - all in all probably not what was intended.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerate some data\\r\\n<img width=\"638\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/assets/90188926/02317b33-30e0-44d2-a51f-559c955319ac\">\\r\\n\\r\\ndf1:\\r\\n<img width=\"147\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/assets/90188926/6da97274-7c1a-4363-b2ac-1a8bb097119f\">\\r\\n\\r\\ndf2:\\r\\n<img width=\"136\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/assets/90188926/dcd9ceda-21bb-4341-8ef2-2e1c4925d6a5\">\\r\\n\\r\\njoin them:\\r\\n<img width=\"618\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/assets/90188926/b3f41136-a7f2-4062-beb6-97906bd31e47\">\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nThe resultant dataframe of a left-join with left-index should have the index of the left data frame.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : fd3f57170aa1af588ba877e8e28c158a20a4886d\\r\\npython                : 3.11.4.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 23.2.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 23.2.0: Wed Nov 15 21:54:10 PST 2023; root:xnu-10002.61.3~2/RELEASE_X86_64\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : i386\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : None\\r\\nLOCALE                : None.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.3\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.0.3\\r\\npip                   : 23.3.2\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.9\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nIPython               : 8.21.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.2.0\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.4\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n',\n",

I think the main selling point of `ruff` here is just the ease of implementing new rules, like the currently unenabled `pytest.warns` one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major difference is that `unwanted-patterns-in-tests` is currently only enabled in `pandas/tests` while with this implementation, `TID251` will be enabled globally. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several approaches we can explore to reconcile the 2 behaviors. \\r\\n- Keep it globally enabled for rule where the number of errors is low (and keep using `pygrep`) for the rest\\r\\n- Use [hierarchical configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#pyprojecttoml-discovery) (I think `pandas` doesn't use it at the moment, so this will be a fairly big change)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's an open issue to track the progress of [flat configuration](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7696), which allows us to keep all rules within 1 config file, but there's not much progress lately.\",\n",
