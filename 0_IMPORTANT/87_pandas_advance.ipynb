For example:\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\nmy_index = pd.Index(['one', 'two', 'three', 'three', 'two', 'one', 'three'])\\r\\nmy_index.sort_values(\\r\\n    key=lambda idx: (idx\\r\\n        .to_series()\\r\\n        .rename(index={'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3})\\r\\n        .index\\r\\n    )\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis is all a bit redundant, and I suspect it's a common use case.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelatedly, sometimes I want to use a different key function for different columns/levels. In order to do that, I actually need to call the sort method multiple times.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Feature Description\\r\\n\\r\\nAccept sequences like `['one', 'two', 'three']` specifying the ascending order of the values.\\r\\n\\r\\nEDIT: Example equivalent to the `sort_values` call above:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nmy_index.sort_values(key=['one', 'two', 'three'])\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso accept dictionaries like `{'col_1': ['one', 'two', 'three'], 'col_3': my_sort_fn}` to sort different columns or levels with different keys in any format.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Alternative Solutions\\r\\n\\r\\nMake sure all data that I want to lexsort is always an ordered Categorical.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Additional Context\\r\\n\\r\\n_No response_\",\n",

This PDEP proposes that Pandas participates in these efforts. The hope is that the bulk of the work would be taken on by myself and/or a colleague at Quansight, and the work required by Pandas maintainers would be minimal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's more information in the PDEP below. Thank you. Looking forward to hearing your feedback.\",\n",

branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Reproducible Example\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\nimport pyarrow as pa\\r\\n\\r\\nser1 = pd.Series([1,2,3,None,10], dtype=pd.Int64Dtype())\\r\\nser2 = pd.Series([1,2,3,pd.NA,10],

For example:\\r\\n```python\\r\\ntd1 = pd.concat([td, pd.Series(pd.Timedelta(days=4000))])\\r\\n```\\r\\n```\\r\\n0    0 days 00:00:01          \\r\\n1    0 days 00:00:00.500000   \\r\\n2    0 days 00:00:00.333333333\\r\\n0    4000 days 00:00:00       \\r\\ndtype: object\\r\\n```\\r\\nIf timedeltas had a `.replace()` method so you could zero out the days, then it would work, but AFAIK such a method doesn't exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nBTW, the same thing is already implemented for floats and datetimes.\\r\\n```python\\r\\n>>> s*10\\r\\n0    10.000000\\r\\n1     5.000000\\r\\n2     3.333333\\r\\ndtype: float64\\r\\n>>> pd.Timestamp(0) + td\\r\\n0   1970-01-01 00:00:01.000000000\\r\\n1   1970-01-01 00:00:00.500000000\\r\\n2   1970-01-01 00:00:00.333333333\\r\\ndtype: datetime64[ns]\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Alternative Solutions\\r\\n\\r\\nn/a\\r\\n\\r\\n### Additional Context\\r\\n\\r\\n_No response_\",\n",

I used the implementation as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29663750/9684872) to format integers in a DataFrame on each display.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee changes between `2.1` and `2.2` to make the linked patch work: [link](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/njab/pull/4/commits/10b0c84ddb28a1dd9c2bd58e9b6af148dbd6c9dc)\\r\\n\\r\\nI see that the styler supports formatting thousands:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\npd.options.styler.format.thousands = ','\\r\\ns = pd.Series([1_000_000]).to_frame()\\r\\ns.style # does change display of s to 1,000,000\\r\\n```\\r\\nhowever\\r\\n```\\r\\ns # will display 1000000\\r\\n```\\r\\nWould it be possible to add the same to the display options?\\r\\n\\r\\n### Feature Description\\r\\n\\r\\npd.options.format.thousands = ','\\r\\n\\r\\nwould need to pass:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nif pd.options.format.thousands:\\r\\n  format_str = f':{pd.options.format.thousands}d'.format\\r\\nelse:\\r\\n  format_str = ':d'.format\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Alternative Solutions\\r\\n\\r\\nChange the default [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/io/formats/format.py#L1475)\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nclass IntArrayFormatter(pf._GenericArrayFormatter):\\r\\n\\r\\n    def _format_strings(self):\\r\\n        formatter = self.formatter or '{:,d}'.format\\r\\n        fmt_values = [formatter(x) for x in self.values]\\r\\n        return fmt_values\\r\\n\\r\\npf._IntArrayFormatter = IntArrayFormatter\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the above patch I get the display I would prefer:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> pd.Series([1_000_000])\\r\\n0    1,000,000\\r\\ndtype: int64\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Additional Context\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking with large integers in tables is made easier if thousands are visually distinguished. Maybe there is already a way to specify that formatter function (`str.format`) for display, which would be perfect.\",\n",

Fair nuff - but then, `DataFrame.any(axis=1, skipna=False)` doesn't?\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nI think I'd expect\\r\\n```python\\r\\n0     True\\r\\n1     <NA>\\r\\n2     <NA>\\r\\n```\\r\\nfrom the `DataFrame.any(axis=1, skipna=False)` example\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : fd3f57170aa1af588ba877e8e28c158a20a4886d\\r\\npython                : 3.10.12.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 5.15.133.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2\\r\\nVersion               : #1 SMP Thu Oct 5 21:02:42 UTC 2023\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_GB.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_GB.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.3\\r\\npytz                  : 2023.3.post1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 59.6.0\\r\\npip                   : 22.0.2\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : 7.4.4\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.2\\r\\nIPython               : 8.19.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.2\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2023.12.2\\r\\ngcsfs                 : 2023.12.2post1\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.11.4\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.25\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.4\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\",\n",
